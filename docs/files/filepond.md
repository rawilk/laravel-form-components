## Introduction

The `file-pond` component provides an easy way to utilize advanced file uploads via [FilePond](https://pqina.nl/filepond/).
Before using this component, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the FilePond library.

## Installation

The following third-party libraries are required for the `file-pond` component to work properly.

-   Alpine.js
-   FilePond

As per the [FilePond docs](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/patterns/installation/), you can install FilePond via npm:

```bash
npm i filepond --save
```

You can then import it in your project using imports:

```js
import * as FilePond from "filepond";

window.FilePond = FilePond;
```

There are also some styles required for FilePond. You should import the styles **before** you import the styles for this package:

```css
@import "filepond/dist/filepond.min.css";
```

See [Third-Party Assets](/docs/laravel-form-components/{version}/installation#user-content-third-party-assets) on the installation guide for further setup information.

## Basic Usage

The most basic usage of the `file-pond` component involves just adding a self-closing tag:

```html
<x-file-pond />
```

This will output the following HTML (omitting JS):

```html
<div>
    <div wire:ignore x-data="filepond(...)">
        <input x-ref="input" type="file" ... />
    </div>
</div>
```

> {note} The FilePond library will completely remove the input element we are rendering from the component once initialized.

## Livewire Integration

The `file-pond` component integrates smoothly with livewire out-of-the-box and just requires you to
provide a `wire:model` to the component. This will help it set up the necessary `server` configuration
options on the library and will handle uploading and reverting automatically for you via livewire.

```html
<x-file-pond wire:model="avatar" />
```

## Options

You can provide options to the FilePond library via an array through the `options` attribute. This requires you
to pass in a PHP array with scalar values only. Below is an example where we set a class of "foo" on the
root element generated by FilePond:

```html
<x-file-pond wire:model="avatar" :options="['className' => 'foo']" />
```

In the defaults configuration for the `file-pond` component, you may specify some default options to always set on a
FilePond instance. They will not apply however if you pass in an array of options via the `options` attribute
on the component.

For a full reference of all options, please consult [the FilePond documentation](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/patterns/api/filepond-instance/#properties).

### Multiple

You can accept multiple files by passing in `multiple` as a boolean value. This attribute has been added as a way
to conveniently set the `allowMultiple` option for FilePond.

### Max Files

You can limit the number of files accepted when `allowMultiple` is set to `true` by providing `max-files` with an
integer value.

This option can be set globally in the config, and on a per-element basis.

### Disabled

You can easily disable the FilePond input by passing `disabled` in as a boolean value.

### Allow Drop

The `allow-drop` boolean attribute has been added as a way to conveniently set the `allowDrop` option. Setting it to `false`
will prevent users from being able to drop files onto the input.

This option can be set globally in the config, and on a per-element basis.

## Callbacks

Since the `options` attribute only accepts scalar values, the component offers a `config` slot that will allow you to
specify an option callbacks, such as `onaddfile`, that you need to:

```html
<x-file-pond wire:model="avatar">
    <x-slot:config> onaddfile(error, file) { // do stuff }, </x-slot:config>
</x-file-pond>
```

This slot is inside a function that returns an object. You'll have access to the following variables:

| variable      | description                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `instance`    | The x-data instance for `filepond`. If you need the filepond instance, you can access it via `instance.__pond` |
| `options`     | The options object generated for FilePond by the component                                                     |
| `pondOptions` | The options for FilePond our JavaScript generated before calling the config slot                               |

## Plugins

The `file-pond` component doesn't make use of any FilePond plugins itself, but you can easily install and implement your own plugins.

First, install the necessary JavaScript and CSS required by the plugin. A list of plugins [can be found here](https://pqina.nl/filepond/plugins.html).

With the plugin's assets installed, you can register them with FilePond either in an external script, or inline in the DOM somewhere. Here's an example
of loading the file type validation plugin in an inline script:

```html
<script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
        FilePond.registerPlugin(FilePondPluginFileValidateType);
    });
</script>
```

If you're into using CDNs, you can add these lines to your layout file for the above example:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/filepond-plugin-file-validate-type/dist/filepond-plugin-file-validate-type.js"></script>
```

## Manually Deleting Files

If you decide to do something like list out the files and delete them yourself manually instead of the revert button provided by FilePond, you will
find that the files still appear to be in FilePond, even though Livewire has actually cleared out your `wire:model` value. To help with this,
the `file-pond` component adds a watcher on your `wire:model` by using `@entangle`. Now, when you remove the files manually, the component
will pick up on those changes and remove the removed files from the FilePond instance.

## Clear Event Listener

You may encounter some edge cases where you may need to clear the files out of the FilePond instance
yourself. When using livewire, this can easily be accomplished by adding the following inside your
component somewhere:

```php
$this->emitSelf('file-pond-clear');
```

If you have multiple filepond instances in a Livewire component, you may pass the id of the filepond instance as an argument
to only clear that specific filepond instance. The `id` should be the `id` you give to the filepond instance, which defaults to
the `name` attribute if omitted.

```php
$this->emitSelf('file-pond-clear', 'avatar');
```

This example will only clear the files out of a filepond instance with the id of `avatar`.

### Browser Clear Event

You can also dispatch an event via JavaScript to clear out a filepond instance as well. If you have multiple filepond
components rendered on the page, you may pass in the id of the component as an argument.

```html
<button @click="$dispatch('file-pond-clear', { id: 'avatar' })">
    Clear avatar
</button>
```

## Type

For convenience, you may specify a `type` attribute that will limit the types of files that can be selected. If a supported type is entered, the component
will set the `acceptedFileTypes` FilePond option for you.

| type        | rendered accept value                                                                           |

| html        | text/html                                                                                       |

> {note} For this to work, you must have the [File Type Validation](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/plugins/file-validate-type/) plugin installed.
