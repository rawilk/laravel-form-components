## Introduction

Laravel form components provides common form components to help build forms faster using Tailwind CSS. Supports validation, old form values, and wire:model.

## Alternatives

This package was created to satisfy my own needs and preferences, and relies on TailwindCSS, TailwindUI, and AlpineJS for styling and functionality. You can always
try one of these alternatives if your needs differ:

-   [Blade UI Kit](https://blade-ui-kit.com/)
-   [Laravel Form Components](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-form-components)
