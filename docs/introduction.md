## Introduction

Form Components for Laravel provides common form components to help build forms faster using Tailwind CSS. Supports validation, old form values, and wire:model.

## Alternatives

This package was created to satisfy my own needs and preferences, and relies on TailwindCSS, TailwindUI, and AlpineJS for styling and functionality. You can always
try one of these alternatives if your needs differ:

-   [Blade UI Kit](https://blade-ui-kit.com/)
-   [Laravel Form Components](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-form-components)

## Disclaimer

This package is not affiliated with, maintained, authorized, endorsed or sponsored by Laravel, TailwindCSS, Laravel Livewire, Alpine.js, or any of its affiliates.
