This package is also heavily inspired by [Laravel Form Components](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-form-components) and [Blade UI Kit](https://blade-ui-kit.com/).
A lot of inspiration for some JS components is taken from [Alpine Headless Components](https://alpinejs.dev/components#headless).

## Alternatives

This package was created to satisfy my own needs and preferences, and relies on TailwindCSS, TailwindUI, and AlpineJS for styling and functionality. You can always
try one of these alternatives if your needs differ:

-   [Blade UI Kit](https://blade-ui-kit.com/)
-   [Laravel Form Components](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-form-components)
